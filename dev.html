                <p class="admin">The trailer for GTA 6 dropped earlier this week, and one of the lines I read over and
                    over
                    again is that “it
                    looks
                    like a photograph”. I can only assume these people have never seen a photograph in their lives,
                    because no,
                    it
                    doesn’t. Much like The Last of Us Part 1 remaster, it looks like a very impressive video game that
                    is still,
                    nonetheless, a video game. Both Rockstar and Naughty Dog have a habit of polishing their best work
                    to sell
                    minor
                    improvements back to us, but after GTA 6 we will eventually get GTA 6. And what does that look like?

                <p id="aboutgta5">Grand Theft Auto V is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and
                    published by Rockstar Games. It is
                    the seventh main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series, following 2008's Grand Theft Auto IV, and the
                    fifteenth
                    instalment overall. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas, based on Southern California, the
                    single-player story
                    follows three protagonists—retired bank robber Michael De Santa (Ned Luke), street gangster Franklin
                    Clinton (Shawn
                    Fonteno), and drug dealer and gunrunner Trevor Philips (Steven Ogg), and their attempts to commit
                    heists while under
                    pressure from a corrupt government agency and powerful criminals. Players freely roam San Andreas's
                    open world
                    countryside and fictional city of Los Santos, based on Los Angeles.</p>
                <p>The game world is navigated on foot and by vehicle, from either a third-person or first-person
                    perspective. Players
                    control the protagonists throughout single-player and switch among them, both during and outside
                    missions. The story is
                    centred on the heist sequences, and many missions involve shooting and driving gameplay. A "wanted"
                    system governs the
                    aggression of law enforcement response to players who commit crimes. In Grand Theft Auto Online, the
                    game's online
                    multiplayer mode, up to 30 players engage in a variety of different cooperative and competitive game
                    modes.</p>
                    <p>Shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide, the game's development began around the time of Grand Theft Auto
                    IV's release. The developers drew influence from many of their previous projects (such as Red Dead Redemption and Max
                    Payne 3) and designed the game around three lead protagonists to innovate on the core structure of its predecessors.
                    Much of the development work constituted the open world's creation, and several team members conducted field research
                    around California to capture footage for the design team. The game's soundtrack features an original score composed by a
                    team of producers who collaborated over several years. Grand Theft Auto V was released in September 2013 for the
                    PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, in November 2014 for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, in April 2015 for Windows, and in March
                    2022 for the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
